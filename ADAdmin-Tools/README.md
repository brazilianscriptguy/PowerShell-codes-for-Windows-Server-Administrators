# ADAdmin-Tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To effectively utilize the scripts in this folder, especially when executing them from a Windows 10 or 11 workstation for administering Windows Server functions, it is essential to have the capability to run **PowerShell scripts (.PS1)** that incorporate the `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` command. For this purpose, the installation of **Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)** is required on the workstation. In Windows Server environments, all necessary modules are natively supported.

## üìÑ Description

This section features a comprehensive suite of PowerShell and Visual Basic scripts designed to streamline the management of **Active Directory (AD)** and **Windows Server environments**. These tools automate and simplify a broad spectrum of administrative tasks involving AD objects such as users, groups, organizational units (OUs), as well as managing server functions and configurations.

> **‚ú® All scripts in this repository are equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), enhancing user interaction and making them more accessible and user-friendly for managing both server and workstation environments.** Each script is designed to generate `.LOG` files and `.CSV` output results, facilitating easy analysis and documentation of administrative actions and outcomes.
