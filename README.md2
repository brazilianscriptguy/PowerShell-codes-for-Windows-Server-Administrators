## To run PowerShell scripts (.PS1) that use the 'Import-Module ActiveDirectory' functionality on Windows 10 workstations, you need to install the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) that include the Active Directory module. RSAT allows you to manage Windows Server roles and features from a Windows 10 PC.

For Windows 10, you can install specific RSAT tools for Active Directory management. Here are the steps:

1. **Open Settings**: Go to 'Settings' on your Windows 10 computer.

2. **Apps & Features**: Click on 'Apps', and then select 'Optional Features'.

3. **Add a Feature**: Click on 'Add a feature'.

4. **Search for RSAT**: In the search bar, type "RSAT". This will show you all available RSAT tools.

5. **Select and Install**: You specifically want to look for and install the following:
    - RSAT: Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Tools
    - RSAT: DNS Server Tools (if you also manage DNS)
    - RSAT: Group Policy Management Tools (if you manage group policies)

6. **Install**: Select these tools and click on 'Install'. 

After the installation, you should be able to run scripts that require the Active Directory module by using the 'Import-Module ActiveDirectory' command in PowerShell. This allows you to perform Active Directory tasks directly from your Windows 10 workstation.

Keep in mind that your user account needs appropriate permissions to manage Active Directory objects, and your PC must be part of the domain or have network access to the domain controllers.
