## üìã Steps to Use ITSM-Templates-WKS Scripts

To effectively deploy and utilize the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` folder to your network‚Äôs **Definitive Media Library (DML)** for centralized storage. This ensures the repository is easily accessible across the network for consistent deployment.

2. **Deploy Locally to Workstations**:
   - Each operator must copy the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` folder from the DML to the `C:\` drive of each workstation requiring configuration. Running scripts locally reduces dependency on network connectivity and ensures efficient execution.

3. **Maintain an Updated DML**:
   - Regularly update the DML repository with the latest version of the ITSM-Templates-WKS folder. This ensures all configurations align with the most current scripts, templates, and organizational standards.

4. **Standardize Local Administrative Privileges**:
   - Limit workstations to **one local administrative account** with elevated privileges.
   - Perform all configurations and management tasks using this designated account to maintain consistency, simplify troubleshooting, and reduce security risks.

5. **Follow the Checklist**:
   - Refer to the `Check-List for Applying ITSM-Templates on Windows 10 and 11 Workstations.pdf` in the main folder for detailed guidance.

6. **Customize Scripts**:
   - Adjust `.vbs` and `.reg` scripts to fit specific organizational needs.

7. **Personalize Workstation Appearance**:
   - Use files in the `C:\ITSM-Templates-WKS\CustomImages\` folder to customize workstation visuals.
   - Modify desktop themes and layouts in the `C:\ITSM-Templates-WKS\ModifyReg\UserDesktopTheme\` folder.

By following these steps, IT professionals can ensure the effective implementation of ITSM standards while maintaining an efficient and secure workstation environment.
