## üìã Clone the Repository

To effectively implement and utilize the ITSM-Templates-WKS scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Centralize the Repository in the Definitive Media Library (DML)**:  
   Clone the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` folder to your network‚Äôs **Definitive Media Library (DML)** path. This central location ensures the repository is easily accessible across your network infrastructure for consistent deployment.

2. **Deploy Locally to Workstations**:  
   Each operator must copy the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` folder from the DML to the `C:\` drive of each workstation requiring configuration. Running scripts from the local environment ensures efficient execution and reduces dependency on network connectivity during configuration.

3. **Maintain a Regularly Updated DML**:  
   Continuously update the DML repository with the latest version of the ITSM-Templates-WKS folder. This ensures all operators and configurations are using the most up-to-date scripts and templates, maintaining alignment with organizational policies and standards.

4. **Standardize Local Administrative Privileges**:  
   - Ensure that only **one local administrative account** with elevated privileges exists on each workstation.  
   - All configurations and management should be performed using this designated administrative instance to ensure consistency, reduce security risks, and simplify troubleshooting.

By adhering to these steps, the ITSM-Templates-WKS repository becomes a powerful tool for maintaining compliance, optimizing workstation configurations, and improving operational efficiency across your organization‚Äôs network.
