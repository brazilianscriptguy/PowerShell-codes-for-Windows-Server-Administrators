## üìã Steps to Use ITSM-Templates-WKS Scripts

Follow these steps for effective deployment of the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` scripts:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Clone the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` folder to your network‚Äôs **Definitive Media Library (DML)**. This ensures centralized storage and easy accessibility for deployment across the organization.

2. **Deploy Locally to Workstations**:  
   - Copy the `ITSM-Templates-WKS` folder from the DML to the `C:\` drive of each workstation requiring configuration. Running scripts locally ensures efficient execution and reduces dependency on network connectivity.

3. **Maintain an Updated DML**:  
   - Regularly update the DML repository with the latest version of the ITSM-Templates-WKS folder. This ensures all scripts, templates, and configurations align with current organizational standards.

4. **Standardize Local Administrative Privileges**:  
   - Limit each workstation to **one local administrative account** with elevated privileges.  
   - Perform all configurations and management tasks using this designated account to ensure consistency and reduce security risks.

5. **Follow the Checklist**:  
   - Refer to the `Check-List for Applying ITSM-Templates on Windows 10 and 11 Workstations.pdf` for detailed, step-by-step guidance.

6. **Customize Scripts**:  
   - Adjust `.vbs` and `.reg` scripts to suit specific organizational requirements.

7. **Personalize Workstation Appearance**:  
   - Use files in the `C:\ITSM-Templates-WKS\CustomImages\` folder to customize wallpapers and user profiles.  
   - Update themes and layouts using the `C:\ITSM-Templates-WKS\ModifyReg\UserDesktopTheme\` folder.

By following these steps, IT professionals can effectively implement ITSM standards while maintaining efficient, compliant, and secure workstation environments.
