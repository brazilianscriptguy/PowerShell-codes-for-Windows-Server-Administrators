## Introduction

Welcome to a comprehensive source of scripts and tools specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of managing Windows Server environments and Windows 10 and 11 workstations. Whether you're aiming to bolster security, optimize system performance, or streamline administrative workflows, our collection within the **ADAdmin-Tools**, **EventLog-Tools**, and **ITSM-Templates** folders is here to elevate your management capabilities.

This repository provides solutions to common administrative and management challenges while improving efficiency and clarity in your operations. Explore our diverse collection and see how these scripts can transform your approach to server and workstation management.

## Features

This repository is organized into distinct folders, each focusing on different areas of Windows Server management and Windows 10 and 11 workstation maintenance using PowerShell and VBScript:

- **ADAdmin-Tools**: Automate and manage Active Directory tasks, such as user, group, and organizational unit (OU) management.
- **EventLog-Tools**: Analyze and generate reports from Windows Event Logs for more effective troubleshooting and monitoring.
- **ITSM-Templates**: Leverage templates and scripts focused on IT Service Management, including workstation configuration, compliance, and automation.

### Key Features

- **In-depth Documentation**: Each folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed descriptions of the scripts' functions, prerequisites, and step-by-step implementation guides.
- **Customizable Solutions**: All scripts are customizable to meet your specific needs by adjusting configuration files and parameters, ensuring optimal performance in your environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the tools in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository to your local machine by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brazilianscriptguy/PowerShell-codes-for-Windows-Server-Administrators.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Folders**: Navigate through the **ADAdmin-Tools**, **EventLog-Tools**, and **ITSM-Templates** folders to find the scripts that meet your needs.

3. **Run the Scripts**:
   - **PowerShell Scripts (`.PS1`)**: Right-click the script and select `Run with PowerShell`.
   - **VBScript Files (`.VBS`)**: Right-click the file and choose `Run with command prompt`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts in this repository, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

### General Requirements

- **PowerShell Version**: Your system should be running PowerShell version 5.1 or later.
- **Administrative Rights**: Most scripts require administrative privileges to execute properly.

### Specific Requirements

- **EventLog-Tools**: Requires the `Microsoft Log Parser utility` to be installed on your system.
- **ADAdmin-Tools**: Requires the `Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)` to be installed on Windows 10 and 11 workstations to enable Active Directory management.

### Installing RSAT on Windows 10 and 11

1. **Open Settings**: Go to `Settings` on your Windows 10 or 11 computer.
2. **Apps & Features**: Navigate to `Apps`, then select `Optional Features`.
3. **Add a Feature**: Click on `Add a feature`.
4. **Search for RSAT**: Type "RSAT" in the search bar to find all available RSAT tools.
5. **Select and Install**: Install the relevant RSAT tools, such as:
   - `Active Directory Domain Services and Lightweight Directory Tools`
   - `DNS Server Tools`
   - `Group Policy Management Tools`

After installing these tools, you will be able to run scripts that require the `Active Directory module` using the `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` command in PowerShell. This setup enables you to perform Active Directory tasks directly from your Windows 10 or 11 workstation.

**Note**: Ensure that your user account has the appropriate permissions to manage Active Directory objects. Additionally, your PC must be part of the domain or have network access to the domain controllers.

- **Script Parameters**: Many scripts come with adjustable parameters, allowing you to further customize their functionality. By tweaking these settings, you can tailor the scripts to suit different scenarios and specific needs. Should you encounter any inconsistencies or require adjustments, please feel free to reach out for assistance.
