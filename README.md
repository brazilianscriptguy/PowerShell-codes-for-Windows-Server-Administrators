# Complete PowerShell and VBScript Toolkit for Managing Windows Servers and Workstations with ITSM Compliance on Windows 10 and 11

Welcome to the **PowerShell Toolset for Windows Server Administration and VBScript Repository**‚Äîa meticulously curated collection of scripts tailored for advanced Windows Server and Windows 10/11 workstation management. Developed by `@brazilianscriptguy`, this repository offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to **streamline Windows Server administration, including Active Directory functions**, while optimizing workstation management, configuration, and ITSM compliance.

‚ú® **All scripts feature a graphical user interface (GUI)** to enhance user interaction. Each script **generates detailed `.log` files** for operational tracking, and some of them **export results to `.csv` files** for easy integration with reporting tools. This makes Windows Server and workstation management more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly.
