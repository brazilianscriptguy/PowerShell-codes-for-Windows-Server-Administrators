# üìÇ Eventlogs-Tools Folder

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before using the scripts in this folder, ensure that the **Microsoft Log Parser utility** is installed on the Windows Server machines where these scripts will be executed. Additionally, to fully leverage these scripts, you must be able to run PowerShell `(.PS1)` scripts, particularly those that utilize the `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` command. If you prefer to execute these scripts from a Windows 10 or 11 workstation, the `Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)` must be installed on that workstation.

## üìÑ Description
This directory contains a collection of scripts specifically designed to process `Windows Event Log files (.evtx)`. These scripts extract relevant information from the logs and generate outputs in .CSV format for straightforward analysis.

> **Each script features a graphical user interface `(GUI)` to enhance user interaction. Additionally, they offer functionalities for generating `.log` files and exporting results to `.csv` files, making the management of servers and workstations more intuitive and efficient.**

5. **EventID4625-LogonAccountFailed.ps1**: Compiles failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625) into a CSV file to identify potential security breaches.

6. **EventID4648-ExplicitCredentialsLogon.ps1**: Logs explicit credential usage (Event ID 4648), generating a CSV report to detect unauthorized access.

7. **EventID4660and4663-ObjectDeletionTracking.ps1**: Tracks object deletion events (Event IDs 4660 and 4663) and organizes them into a CSV report.

8. **EventID4771-KerberosPreAuthFailed.ps1**: Identifies Kerberos pre-authentication failures (Event ID 4771) and outputs findings to a CSV file.

9. **EventID4800and4801-WorkstationLockStatus.ps1**: Tracks workstation locking/unlocking events (Event IDs 4800 and 4801) and provides a CSV report.

10. **EventID5136-5137-5141-ADObjectChanges.ps1**: Analyzes Active Directory object changes/deletions (Event IDs 5136, 5137, and 5141) and generates a CSV report.

11. **EventIDs1074-6006-6008-6013-SystemRestarts.ps1**: Retrieves ordinary system restarts and unexpected shutdowns (EventID 6008) into a CSV file for diagnosing system instability, and generates a CSV report.

12. **EventLogFiles-MigratorTool.ps1**: Manages Windows Server Event Log files by reorganizing, moving, and resizing them for optimized accessibility.

13. **COMING SOON**: Stay tuned for the next series of EventID analyses, providing more innovative and efficient tools to enhance system administration and event log management.
