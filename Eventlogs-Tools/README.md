üìÇ Files in the Eventlogs-Tools Folder

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the scripts in this folder, ensure that the **Microsoft Log Parser utility** is installed on your system. Additionally, to fully utilize these scripts, you must have the ability to execute PowerShell scripts `(.PS1)`, especially those that use the `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` command. This is particularly important on Windows 10 and 11 Workstations, which require the installation of `Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)`.

Each script in this repository **features a graphical user interface** `(GUI)`, enhances user interaction, and includes functionalities for **generating operational** `.log` files and **exporting results** to `.csv` files, making server and workstation management more intuitive and user-friendly.
