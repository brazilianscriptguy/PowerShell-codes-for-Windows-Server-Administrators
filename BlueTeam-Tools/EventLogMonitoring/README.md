# üìÇ EventLogMonitoring Folder

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To effectively use the scripts in this folder, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Microsoft Log Parser Utility**  
   - **Installation:** Required on Windows Server machines or Windows 10/11 workstations.  
   - **Usage:** Facilitates advanced querying and analysis of various log formats.

2. **Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)**  
   - **Installation:** Necessary on Windows 10/11 workstations to fully leverage scripts that use the `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` command.  
   - **Usage:** Enables Active Directory and other remote server role management.

You can also run scripts that process `.evtx` files directly from a Windows 10 or 11 workstation.

## üìÑ Description

This folder contains a suite of PowerShell scripts crafted to process **Windows Event Log files (.evtx)**. These tools extract key data from event logs and generate outputs in `.CSV` format, enabling easy analysis and reporting.

> **‚ú® Each script comes with a graphical user interface (GUI), enhancing user interaction. They also generate `.log` files and export results to `.csv`, simplifying server and workstation management.**

### üìú Script Descriptions (Alphabetically Ordered)

1. **EventID-Count-AllEvtx-Events.ps1**  
   Counts occurrences of each EventID in EVTX files and exports the results to a CSV, aiding event log analysis.

2. **EventID307-PrintAudit.ps1**  
   Audits print activities by analyzing Event ID 307 from the Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational log, providing a detailed tracking report.

3. **EventID4624-LogonViaRDP.ps1**  
   Generates a CSV report on RDP logon activities (Event ID 4624) to monitor remote access and identify potential security risks.

4. **EventID4624-UserLogonTracking.ps1**  
   Tracks user logon activities (Event ID 4624) and produces a CSV report for auditing and compliance purposes.

5. **EventID4625-LogonAccountFailed.ps1**  
   Compiles failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625) into a CSV, helping to identify potential breaches and failed login patterns.

6. **EventID4648-ExplicitCredentialsLogon.ps1**  
   Logs explicit credential usage (Event ID 4648) and generates a CSV report, aiding in detecting unauthorized credential use.

7. **EventID4660and4663-ObjectDeletionTracking.ps1**  
   Tracks object deletion events (Event IDs 4660 and 4663), organizing data into a CSV for auditing security and access changes.

8. **EventID4771-KerberosPreAuthFailed.ps1**  
   Identifies Kerberos pre-authentication failures (Event ID 4771) and outputs findings to a CSV, helping diagnose authentication issues.

9. **EventID4800and4801-WorkstationLockStatus.ps1**  
   Tracks workstation locking and unlocking events (Event IDs 4800 and 4801), generating a CSV report for monitoring workstation security.

10. **EventID5136-5137-5141-ADObjectChanges.ps1**  
    Analyzes Active Directory object changes and deletions (Event IDs 5136, 5137, and 5141), producing a CSV report for auditing AD modifications.

11. **EventIDs1074-6006-6008-6013-SystemRestarts.ps1**  
    Retrieves details on system restarts and unexpected shutdowns (Event ID 6008), outputting results in a CSV to diagnose system issues.

12. **Migrate-WinEvtStructure-Tool.ps1**  
    Moves Windows Event Log files to a new directory, updating registry paths; stops and restarts the Event Log service to move .evtx files; requires administrative privileges.
    
### COMING SOON:
New EventID analysis scripts will be added, bringing innovative tools to enhance system administration and event log management.
